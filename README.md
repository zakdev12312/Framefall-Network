# 🌐 Framefall Studio

**Framefall Studio** is a central hub designed to host and interlink a constellation of modular nodes and experimental sub-projects. It functions as both infrastructure and archive—a platform where ideas converge, evolve, and sometimes collide.

At its core, Framefall serves as the connective tissue between creative systems and infrastructural components. Whether you're contributing utilities, lore-driven modules, or something entirely abstract, each piece plays into a wider framework of structured creativity.

## 🧠 Purpose

- Host diverse modular projects under a unified architectural philosophy
- Enable cross-node interactions and infrastructural reuse
- Serve as a living repository for ideas in motion

---

## 🧩 Project Scope

Framefall is intentionally vague and structurally flexible. Projects within this network may range from:

- Development tools and prototypal infrastructure  
- Creative fragments or abstract modules  
- Social mechanics, user shells, or lore containers  

This is not a product—it's a platform for platforms. Expect chaos. Expect pattern.
