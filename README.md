# ðŸŒ€ Framefall Network

**A modular host for fragments, echoes, and experimental ideas. A static framework where creativity collects and refracts.**

## Purpose

Framefall Network exists as an abstract containerâ€”an adaptable space where diverse content modules can coexist. It favors ambiguity, invites introspection, and thrives on creative repurposing.

There is no fixed shape, only a commitment to:
- Modularity without hierarchy
- Memory without chronology
- Creativity without constraint

Each module reflects a distinct theme, concept, or utility. Together, they form a decentralized narrative across digital terrain.

## Philosophy

Framefall is not a brand. (yet)
Framefall is not a tool.

Framefall is a place.

A frame for falling ideas. A network of intentional fragments.
